\abstract{%
Heterogeneous processors such as ARM's big.LITTLE have become popular as they offer a choice between performance and energy efficiency.
However, the core configurations are fixed at design time which offers a limited amount of adaptation. 
Dynamic Multicore Processors (DMPs) bridge the gap between homogeneous and fully reconfigurable systems by grouping cores together (composition) to adapt to the needs of different workloads.
There exists little research in finding out when to group cores and what hardware is required to obtain the best performance out of this technique.

This thesis first demonstrates that ahead of time thread and core partitioning used to improve the performance of multithreaded programs can be automated. 
This is done by analysing static code features to generate a machine learning model that determines a processor configuration that leads to good performance for an application. 
The machine learning model is able to predict a configuration that is within 16\% of the performance of the best configuration from the search space.

This is followed by studying how dynamically adapting the size of a composition at runtime can be used to reduce energy consumption whilst maintaining the same speedup as the fastest static core composition.
An analysis of how much energy can be saved by adapting the size of the composition at runtime is conducted, showing that dynamic reconfiguration can reduce energy consumption by 42\% on average.
A model is then built using linear regression which analyses the feautres of basic blocks being executed to determine if the current composition should be reconfigured; on average it reduces energy consumption by 37\%.

Finally the hardware mechanisms that drive core composition are explored.
A new fetching mechanism for core composition is proposed, where cores fetch code in a round robin fashion.
The use of value prediction in the context of core composition is also motivated, as large core compositions are more susceptible to data-dependencies.
Using a perfect value predictor with perfect branch prediction and the new fetching scheme the performance of a large core composition can be improved by a factor of up to 3x, and 1.88x on average.
On the other hand using state of the art value prediction with a normal branch predictor leads to an average performance improvement of up to 2.7x, and 1.33x on average.

As computers become more and more powerful, the main component that drives this performance --- the central processing unit --- is becoming harder to improve on due to a multitude of reasons.
In order to compensate for the fact processor designers cannot increase the performance of a a single processor core; the common philosophy has been to pack multiple copies of smaller cores into a single package.
Whilst this approach has been successful to a certain degree, some applications cannot benefit from spreading their computation on multiple processor cores but instead perform best on larger cores.
To compensate for this, hardware designers propose heterogeneous processors where different types of cores are on the same package.
However, this still requires that the design of the processor be determined before it is built.
This reduces the flexibility of the system and thus may potentially limit performance on some applications.
Therefore, a new processor model was created, one where the cores can be grouped together at any time in order to form larger cores: these processors are called Dynamic Multicore Processors (DMPs).
DMPs can adapt themselves to the needs of the program at hand which helps improve the performance of the program.

This thesis explores how to determine ways in which the DMP can automatically reconfigure itself to adapt to the needs of the program at hand.
Whilst previous research has looked into ways of reconfiguring the processor using hand-crafted algorithms, this is not an efficient solution as it requires intimate knowledge of the processor and is time consuming.
Automating this process makes these types of processors more accessible, as programmers will not have to think about the underlying hardware when they write their programs.
The reconfiguration can be used to either make the programs execute faster, or consume less energy.
This thesis shows that reconfiguring the processor can be fully automated through the use of machine learning, thus removing the need of hand-crafting an algorithm.
Finally, the mechanisms that determine how the processor functions once reconfigured are analysed to see if any improvements can be made.
By modifying the way the processor behaves, the performance of programs can be improved even more.
This motivates further research in these types of processors.
