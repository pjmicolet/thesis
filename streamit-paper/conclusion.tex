In this chapter the problem of partitioning both software and hardware for a Dynamic Multicore Processor is presented.
The chapter analyses a set of streaming workloads based on StreamIt, extracting features which highly influence both the required number of threads and core composition.
Using this data a machine learning model is introduced which is able to determine how many threads a StreamIt application needs and pick an appropriate chip topology.
The model predicts configurations close to the performance of the best design points from the sampled space.
 %By automating the decision of core composition we motivate the use of DMPs for accelerating applications without any involvement from the programmer.
