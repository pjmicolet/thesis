In this paper we presented the problem of partitioning both software and hardware for a Dynamic Multicore Processor.
We analysed a set of streaming workloads based on StreamIt, extracting features which highly influence both the required number of threads and core composition.
Using this data we introduced a machine learning model which is able to determine how many threads a StreamIt application needs and pick an appropriate chip topology.
The model predicts configurations close to the performance of the best design points from the sampled space.
By automating the decision of core composition we motivate the use of DMPs for accelerating applications without any involvement from the programmer.
