\begin{abstract}     
    The emergence of dynamic multicore systems allows for new hardware
    optimisations where hardware modifies itself to match the software's needs.
    In this paper we describe an automatic method of determining how to
    partition a program and associate each partition to a set of fused cores in
    order  to improve the performance of streaming applications through the use
    of machine learning. We explore the difficulties of extracting important
    features out of programs in order to accurately decide the correct chip
    topology.  Using the methods described in the paper we can achieve up to 2
    times speedup on certain applications.
