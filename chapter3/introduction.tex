This chapter is currently a dump of all information that I've gathered which doesn't fit in the other two chapters.
Subjects I want to cover in this chapter are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A more in-depth analysis on how we can automatically determine sections of code that are good for core-fusion.
\item How sequential fetching in core-fusion is a detriment to performance.
\end{itemize}
