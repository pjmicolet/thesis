\subsection{Benchmarks}

To evaluate how the hardware modifications improve the effectiveness of core composition; the same benchmarks used in Chapter~\ref{chp:cases} are used here.
These benchmarks are all from the San-Diego Vision Benchmark Suite (SD-VBS)~\cite{sdvbs}, which is composed of a set of vision and image analysis applications.
The previous chapter showed that even with code optimisations, core compositions do not perform optimally when executing the benchmarks.
Some of the programs, such as \bm{MSER} or \bm{Multi\_NCut} features an average block size of under 10 instructions per block, making it difficult to use core composition efficiently.

\subsection{Value Predictor}
Value predictors that can generate predictions both quickly and accurately are still actively being researched~\cite{peraisVTAGE2014,sheikh2017value}.
In order to motivate the use of value prediction for core composition, it is first important to abstract away current implementation details of state of the art predictors.
By considering a 100\% accurate prediction rate and immediate value prediction, this helps determine how much value prediction can help improve performance.
Once the maximum speedup is determined, using an implementation of state-of-the art can help understand how far current value predictors are from the best performance.

Thus, this chapter uses two value predictors: a perfect value predictor that  can predict any value in a single cycle, and a VTAGE~\cite{peraisVTAGE2014} value predictor.

\subsection{Execution} The previous chapter showed that the SD-VBS benchmarks feature phases of IPC, and that these phases often repeat.
These benchmarks are structured as pipelines with distinct passes; often times the execution of a benchmark will iterate over the pipeline multiple times.
This means that performance improvements can be analysed before the program has finished executing.
As this chapter is only concerned with demonstrating that the new hardware modifications outperform the current implementation, the benchmarks are executed long enough to capture all the phases.

This chapter is concerned with how changing the hardware will improve the performance of core composition.
In order to motivate new research in branch prediction and value predictors and their use for core composition, it is essential to know what the maximum performance improvements are when using these techniques. %they're not techniques but you get the idea.
Thus, a perfect value predictor and branch predictor are considered for the performance analysis.
